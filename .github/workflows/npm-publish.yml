# ⚠️ THIS WORKFLOW IS DISABLED ⚠️
# 
# Versioning and publishing is now handled automatically by changeset-version.yml
# Changesets workflow automatically:
# 1. Creates version bump PR when changesets are merged to master
# 2. Publishes to npm when version bump PR is merged
#
# This workflow is kept for reference but will NOT run automatically.
# If you need manual release via GitHub Release, you can:
# 1. Delete changeset-version.yml
# 2. Uncomment the "on:" section below
# 3. Remove workflow_dispatch
